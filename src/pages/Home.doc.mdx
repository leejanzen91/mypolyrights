# What rights do we want?

## -Right to Legality
## -Right to Family
## -Right to Safety

It’s important to note that discrimination is a multilayered topic. We focus on polyamory here, but there is also complex discrimination faced by people of color and LGBT+ peoples who often intersect with polyamory. [1][2] Many of the articles cited discuss laws against “adultry”; understand that even when all parties consent to multiple partners, in the eyes of the law it is still considered “cheating” and prosecuted as such.
## Right to legality
Polygamy is the act or condition of a person marrying another person while still being lawfully married to another spouse. In the United States, all instances of polygamy are legally defined as  bigamy, and are illegal at both the federal and state level. Bigamy is punishable by a fine, imprisonment, or both, according to the law of the individual state and the circumstances of the offense. Polygamy was outlawed federally by the Edmunds Act, and there are laws against the practice in all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico. Due to state laws against it, polygamy is not actively prosecuted at the federal level; however the practice is considered "against public policy", and accordingly the U.S. government does not recognize bigamous marriages for immigration purposes (that is, the government would not allow one of the spouses to petition for immigration benefits for the other). This is the case even if the spouses are legal citizens of the country where the bigamous marriage was celebrated. Any immigrant who is coming to the United States to practice polygamy is inadmissible.

Many US courts (e.g. Turner v. S., 212 Miss. 590, 55 So.2d 228) treat bigamy as a strict liability crime; in some jurisdictions, a person can be convicted of a felony even if he reasonably believed he has only one legal spouse. For example, if a person has the mistaken belief that their previous spouse is dead or that their divorce is final, they can still be convicted of bigamy if they marry a new person.[3]
It is illegal to be with anyone other than your spouse in 15 states [4]
There are 15 countries in which it is legal to stone people to death for adultery [5] 
## Right to family
Polyamorous parents are discriminated against in our court systems, as well as socially. [6]
Polyamorous parents risk losing custody in divorce hearings due to being polyamorous. [7]
Only two parents may be recognized on US birth certificates, even if more individuals may be a parent to a child. Rights of guardianship are important to the wellbeing of childrens growth and future success.
Polyamorous parents can be denied the opportunity to adopt or foster children to grow their families.
On some occasions, poly families can be targeted by communities, resulting in the potential removal of children by the state. [8]

Marriage comes with an extensive set of over 1000+ family laws to protect individuals in their binding contract. Polyamorous individuals have to go through costly lawyer fees for the same rights, and there is always the chance that these documents will not be upheld in court. While many polyamorous individuals do not seek a traditional marriage, we still require the legal rights to protect and care for our families when dealing with issues surrounding health, death, and property/assets. [9]
Discrimination in the military
Adultery is grounds for dishonorable discharge from a military career, regardless of the consent of partners involved. [10]
## The right to safety
The right for polyamorousrelationships to be treated with the same weight and seriousness granted to monogamous relationships, and not as a "kinky sex thing".
The right to be public with how we live our lives without fear.
The right to not be the target of assault, physical or sexual, due to our relationship orientation.

### The right to not be discriminated against for
#### Housing
#### Jobs [11]
#### Health care
Polyamory is not included in the civil rights act of 1964. As such it is legal to deny individuals based on their relationship orientation.

This discussion is founded on the belief that humans have the right to participate in whatever romantic relationships they so choose, given full consent from all parties in those relationships. Polyamory is an ethical relationship style of engaging in multiple romantic partnerships. The term ‘polyamorous’ is a word that is used or discussed in educated circles, but those without access to the same books, terms, or education may also be practicing polyamory in their lives without this knowledge. However, this does not mean that those who lack  words like “ethical non-monogamy” and “polyamory” are any less deserving of rights. Many find that polyamory is for them an inherent part of who they are, and have felt that way for long before they received the education and means to “do relationships right.” As such you will find that a lot of what we discuss here isn’t just about polyamory, but the discrimination against adultery in our society. This is in part because even when multiple adults are in a consenting relationship, it is still considered adultery in the eyes of the law to engage with those outside of the marriage contract if one is created. People participate in relationships throughout their lifetimes with many individuals and dynamics involved, and we take the stance thathese relationships are not lesser merely because the individuals don’t have the same words we might choose to use in a more academic or modern culture. We can find evidence of many historical figures participating in polyamorous relationships, and even when all parties consented it is typical that history vilifies any romantic partnerships beyond their spouse. [1.1] Polyamory is a relationship people participate in all over the world, facing threats of violence or death does not stop individuals from loving more. It’s an identity people hold onto despite how many people in their life they may be involved in a relationship with, because when they found the means to describe themselves they found it was a part of who they are.
